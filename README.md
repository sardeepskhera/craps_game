To play the game, a player rolls a pair of dice (2 die). After the dice come to rest, the sum of the faces of the 2 die is calculated. 

If the sum is 7 or 11 on the first throw, the player wins and the game is over. 
If the sum is 2, 3, or 12 on the first throw, the player loses and the game is over. 
If the sum is 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10 on the first throw, then that sum is known as the player’s “point”. 

To win, he must keep throwing the dice until he/she “makes his point”, that is, the sum of the dice is equal to his point. 
The player loses if he throws a 7 before making his point. In either case, the game is over. 
The player will be assigned 100 chips before beginning to play the game. Each time the game is played, the user will be asked to make a wager. 
If the player wins the game, s(he) receives double his wager. If s(he) loses, then the wager is lost. 

The game is played until the player no longer wishes to play or until the chips are all used. 
At this time, the total number of chips remaining display.
